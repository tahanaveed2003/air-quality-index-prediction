# Air Quality Index (AQI) Prediction Using Machine Learning
This repository contains a Machine Learning project for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) using the Beijing Air Quality dataset.
The project applies Linear Regression as a baseline model to establish fundamental relationships between air pollutant concentrations and AQI, followed by XGBoost to capture non-linear patterns and improve prediction accuracy.
The dataset includes historical air pollution measurements (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃) along with meteorological features collected from monitoring stations across Beijing.
The complete ML pipeline includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and comparison of model performance.
